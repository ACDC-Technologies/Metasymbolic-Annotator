    mineral
:



a mineral is a naturally occurring substance, representable by a chemical formula, that is usually solid and inorganic, and has a crystal structure. it is different from a rock, which can be an aggregate of minerals or non-minerals and does not have a specific chemical composition. the exact definition of a mineral is under debate, especially with respect to the requirement a valid species be abiogenic, and to a lesser extent with regard to it having an ordered atomic structure. the study of minerals is called mineralogy.

</p>lead
:



lead (/lɛd/) is a chemical element in the carbon group with symbol pb (from latin: plumbum) and atomic number 82. lead is a soft, malleable and heavy post-transition metal. metallic lead has a bluish-white color after being freshly cut, but it soon tarnishes to a dull grayish color when exposed to air. lead has a shiny chrome-silver luster when it is melted into a liquid. it is also the heaviest (has the highest atomic number) non-radioactive element (two radioactive elements, namely technetium and promethium, are lighter).

</p>ion
:



an ion (/ˈaɪən, -ɒn/) is an atom or a molecule in which the total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons, giving the atom or molecule a net positive or negative electrical charge.
ions can be created, by either chemical or physical means, via ionization. in chemical terms, if a neutral atom loses one or more electrons, it has a net positive charge and is known as a cation. if an atom gains electrons, it has a net negative charge and is known as an anion.

</p>metal
:



a metal (from greek μέταλλον métallon, "mine, quarry, metal") is a material (an element, compound, or alloy) that is typically hard, opaque, shiny, and has good electrical and thermal conductivity. metals are generally malleable — that is, they can be hammered or pressed permanently out of shape without breaking or cracking — as well as fusible (able to be fused or melted) and ductile (able to be drawn out into a thin wire). about 91 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals (some elements appear in both metallic and non-metallic forms).
astrophysicists use the term "metal" to collectively describe all elements other than hydrogen and helium.



<p>
--------
</p>solution
:



in chemistry, a solution is a homogeneous mixture composed of two or more substances. in such a mixture, a solute is a substance dissolved in another substance, known as a solvent. the solution more or less takes on the characteristics of the solvent including its phase, and the solvent is commonly the major fraction of the mixture.

</p>semiconductor
:



a semiconductor material has an electrical conductivity value falling between that of a conductor, such as copper, and an insulator, such as glass. semiconductors are the foundation of modern electronics. semiconducting materials exist in two types - elemental materials and compound materials. the modern understanding of the properties of a semiconductor relies on quantum physics to explain the movement of electrons and holes in a crystal lattice.



<p>
--------
</p>crystal
:



a crystal or crystalline solid is a solid material whose constituents, such as atoms, molecules or ions, are arranged in a highly ordered microscopic structure, forming a crystal lattice that extends in all directions. in addition, macroscopic single crystals are usually identifiable by their geometrical shape, consisting of flat faces with specific, characteristic orientations.
the scientific study of crystals and crystal formation is known as crystallography. the process of crystal formation via mechanisms of crystal growth is called crystallization or solidification.



<p>
--------
</p>electron
:



the electron is a subatomic particle, symbol e− or β−, with a negative elementary electric charge. electrons belong to the first generation of the lepton particle family, and are generally thought to be elementary particles because they have no known components or substructure. the electron has a mass that is approximately 1/1836 that of the proton. quantum mechanical properties of the electron include an intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of a half-integer value in units of ħ, which means that it is a fermion.
